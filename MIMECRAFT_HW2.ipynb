One of my colleagues and I were involved in the contract award and recommendation review with a foreign contracting firm in the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in Nigeria for the supply of ammunations, hard/soft wares,phamaceuticals/medical items,light and heavy duty vehicles, ammunations procured from United Nations  ATOMI and other international agencies. We were involved in supplying equipment for the purchase of aircraft,phantom aircraft,consignment and equipment for the supply chain development of the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in Nigeria. We are the only partners with whom we have a position in this business. We negotiated a down payment of 35% of the total sum to be used in collaboration with you for the purchase and lease of an aircraft,to be used for civilian and military purposes respectively, by the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in the country. The equipment was supposed to be delivered to you as a result of a positive balance in our favour to enable us take delivery of the equipment in your name. Instead, we received negative balances as a result of over invoicing and over invoiced taxes,and as such, we are seeking to transfer the equipment into your account to enable us transfer the funds to your country for investment purposes. We agreed on the amount when we met in my chambers the previous month. We have agreed to share the equipment and relevant funds as follows:- (1) 70% for us (2) 10% for you (3) 5% for the expences both will incure during the time of transfer. We hope to invest our share in a real estate project in your country as you will be our business partner. Please note that this transaction is risk free. If the equipment is delivered to you as desired and your company's role is properly filled, we shall organize and implement the project in your country into the schedule and estimate as soon as the equipment is in your possession. At the conclusion of the transfer, you will be given 35% of the total sum, 60% will be for me and you while 5% will be for the expences both will incure during the time of the transfer. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. You can reach me with my confidential fax number +23416704189 or you can send me email to allow me brief you the procedure. Awaiting to hear from you soon Mr Bahram el Sisi.\n",

During the war, some private security company officers were on leave, when the conflict erupted in my country. I was made to work as a personal security guard to the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone after the death of the former President, ROBERT VANESSA, during a military campaign, which took us a long time to resolve. During this time I was regularly in Sierra Leone, mainly to pick up shipments from the Customs, who had to change their shipping containers to take goods through the Suez Canal tow as a protection for his precious Diamonds. The Sixty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars was changed into your account when the former President was killed. I am presently in England, working with a private firm, as a civil servant, so I cannot operate a foreign account, but I have made arrangement to have that right. Within the last few days, my proposal to you was accepted by a member of the staff of the private security company who is a Diamond/Gold Merchant and he directed me into business relationship with you. We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, and 2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction, which includes, telephone bills, theft and any form of general miscellaneous would be borne by you. We have decided to business relationship because you are familiar with private sector and you would be expected to assist us in investment in your country. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

During this time I was regularly in Sierra Leone, mainly to pick up shipments from the Customs, who had to change their shipping containers to take goods through the Suez Canal tow as a protection for his precious Diamonds. The Sixty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars was changed into your account when the former President was killed. I am presently in England, working with a private firm, as a civil servant, so I cannot operate a foreign account, but I have made arrangement to have that right. Within the last few days, my proposal to you was accepted by a member of the staff of the private security company who is a Diamond/Gold Merchant and he directed me into business relationship with you. We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, and 2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction, which includes, telephone bills, theft and any form of general miscellaneous would be borne by you. We have decided to business relationship because you are familiar with private sector and you would be expected to assist us in investment in your country. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr.Steve Besnih\n",

            "I have been out of the office and have just seen your email.  I was wondering if you could call me ASAP and discuss the most  expeditious way to close a US$350M ($585MM loan) unfunded foreign direct investment (FDI) project in your country.  It is a long-term project and requires a lot of finance, but there was no apparent way this could be funded without adversely impacting US manufacturing. You did mention that the project should be in place by May 2010, which seems to be a reasonable horizon for a project of this duration.  I  presume that you received this message in your system as well, but could you look at it and let me know if there are any  problems with it before I forward my response. Thanks.\n",

The contract was actually awarded in favour of the Chinese firm (Electricité Commercial Power) but was changed to the non-Chinese candidates after the re-election of President Robert Mugabe.

            " Urgent  Business Proposal Dear Friend, I am Zuhair Idris, the son of Late Mr. Laurent Gube of Sierra Leone, who was assassinated by the rebels during the war in my country. I inherited a total sum of $18,000,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million United States dollars) from my late father. This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company in Dakar, Senegal, to avoid any shock to the family fortune if he were to die. This large sum of money was deposited in a security-reserve vault, awaiting claim by my government if/when need be.  Now this money belongs to me as a foreign beneficiary, I am 18 years old and a legal resident in the Senegal, my main purpose of contacting you is for you to help me receive this consignment into your account in any part of your country. This money was deposited as family valuable after my late father's death. It is stuck in a holding security-reserve bank here in Dakar, with my name as the next of kin.  This deposit was made to avoid the bank from confiscating or freezing the account in my name. No record is known about this account by the bank as no one knows about this account, the card in my name alone has deposited and the security-reserve bank does not know the owner.  If you accept to assist my family in this transaction, I hope you will treat it with utmost confidentiality and courtesy, keeping strictly confidential.  I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.I alone have the means of contacting you and I alone know of the contents of the mail.I will need you to come to my country immediately so as to claim this money in your country or anyone in your country's name, as all arrangements will be made for you there immediately you receive the money.  I will also need you to assist me in investing this money in a lucrative business. Your time is of the essence here, I assure you 100% security and risk free involvement.

I am MR.B.K.TARU, a former managing director of Tykem Mining Corporation in (KEN'AI) Sierra Leone, a consultant to the Sierra Leone Mining Epoch, and a full time  consultant contract appraiser with Grupo SA (European Construction Contractors). I was the victim of a car accident along Tijani-Lagos express road on the 1st of October 2001 .All the deceased occupants of the vehicle died there while I was on holidays with my family with my mother and two of our travelling companions. Since we are now in South Africa, I decided to transfer the sum of US$43,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million United States Dollar) into a safe foreign account and there make arrangement for it to be had. I wanted to use this opportunity to request for assistance in the business of investment and consequent transfer of the funds to a foreign account, because I need your firm's assistance in  operations in your country. Because my present location is not safe such as if I left the fund in your country. I will be glad if you can assist me in transferring this fund out of West Africa and into an account in a foreign country where I can invest it and also help me receive the fund from the fund manager.  I will be very glad if you will consider my proposal and take this proposal very serious. You should be rest assured that this transaction is risk free with  the sum of US$43,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million United States Dollar) in your account.

I am MR.B.K.TARU, a former managing director of Tykem Mining Corporation in (KEN'AI) Sierra Leone, a consultant to the Sierra Leone Mining Epoch, and a full time  consultant contract appraiser with Grupo SA (European Construction Contractors). I was the victim of a car accident along Tijani-Lagos express road on the 1st of October 2001 .All the deceased occupants of the vehicle died there while I was on holidays with my family with my mother and two of our travelling companions. Since we are now in South Africa, I decided to transfer the sum of US$43,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million United States Dollar) into a safe foreign account and there make arrangement for it to be had. I wanted to use this opportunity to request for assistance in the business of investment and consequent transfer of the funds to a foreign account, because I need your firm's assistance in  operations in your country. Because my present location is not safe such as if I left the fund in your country. I will be glad if you can assist me in transferring this fund out of West Africa and into an account in a foreign country where I can invest it and also help me receive the fund from the fund manager.  I will be very glad if you will consider my proposal and take this proposal very serious. You should be rest assured that this transaction is risk free with  the sum of US$43,000,000.00 (Thirty Three Million United States Dollar) in your account. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email andupon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  please respect my confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction is risk free and a success of this nature requires a very big risk.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of a consortium of Multinationals in the Works and Housing Sector in favour of a company of which I was one of the few contractors that actually performed the project. The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names.

            "Yes.  I think we can go to court.  Myself and my partner are weighing legal issues.  Should we try to enfeeble a contract and beg forgiveness from the poor god?  Our pastor actually suggested we do just that.  The courts would probably think we were trying to steal something, as we had never bothered to get a court order before.  Judge William Rehnquist was very interested in what our business is.  He wanted to hear from our \"innovators\".  Our business is basically a series of \"marketing\" ideas that no one has tried yet.  Don't we have an \"innovator's dandy\" gene?  We need to show him that the technical know-how we picked up in college is actually transferable and that we can develop viable and valuable business ideas in the time it takes to make your day, or to make your day if we do steal something.  It's much better to have a brilliant, if somewhat embarrassing, series of presentations that show you how to make a living than have it blown out of proportion.\n",

            "We may as well just try to start a \"Company B\" to market, since we already have a \"Company C\" under our belts.  I'd argue that a company C is actually in much worse shape than a \"traditional\" oil company.  Most of my \"innovations\" were actually conceived as a hedge against default, rather than as a start up.  If we want to make money, we need to raise capital, and if we raise capital, it's better if we do it now rather than wait till \"The Black Swan\" dies.  The insurance companies didn't exactly love \"The Black Swan\". \n",

            "I'm not saying we can't have nice things.  I'm saying we should have nice things to look forward to rather than looking forward to the worst case scenario.  That being said, I don't think \"the worst possible\" scenario is going to happen anytime soon, and there's a reason why we're in it.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I'm not trying to start a \"company B\" today.  I'm trying to buy a business that can help \"the people\" in your area.  That's it.  You're not going to start a business that can help people in a time of need.  And the insurance that you and your \"innovators\" have built up doesn't even factor into this.  If\n",

My country is in dire need of an investment, the present Government is about to leave office with a rescript from the World Trade Organization,this rescript was due to excessive profit and  pressure from the United Nation of  aid agency (UNASIL). I have successfully negotiated a good percentage for your assistance, so I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum.      I have also met with some members of the board of directors of Liberia National  Petroleum Corporation (LNPPC) who are in favour of my proposal and would enable me to transfer the funds out of Nigeria for investment in your country.

On June 6, 1997, an American Oil Merchant/Contingent with the Thai Petrochemical Corporation, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18,300,000.00, (Eighteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Thai Petrochemical Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18,300,000.00 has carefully and precisely been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Thai Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Thai Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Clifford Stone so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that a lawyer will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of a reputable and honest Foreigner as a favourer and the legal agreement will be executed under my supervision and direction.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

            " Greeting in the name of our dearest friend Dear Friend This letter may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you have never met before.  However, it is coming from a reliable source; I have decided to contact you based on the news report of The Nigeria Stock Exchange. I got your contact address from a business directory in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry where I discovered that a deceased business partner of mine, Mr. James Nimely, had left the country. He had until his death in a private plane crash landed in Johannesburg, South Africa on the 3rd of October 2003.  He died with his family on the 31st of May 2004, and the case of the missing million six hundred thalers has been traced to his South African Business Bank (S.A.B) branch in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The money was generated during a boating excursion on the 8th of April, 2000, and is presently in my branch. An enquiry was therefore opened regarding possible business associates, and among those whom the enquiry referred for further investigation were:(a)a Foreigner, (b)a South African National of Late Mr James Nimely.(c)a Mr. Richard Gubu. After further investigation, it was discovered that (a)all the deceased partners in the business, (b)all Late Mr James Nimely's listed next of kin in the South African Business Law, (c)all his Business transactions were made with foreign accounts, and (d)the money will be  lost to the Government if not claimed within the next ten official working days. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased partner, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary next of the estate. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I will then provide you with the details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because we will require your assistance to invest our share in real estate within your country.

            "I am sorry I missed you last night.  I have been out of the shower and my aunty noticed me in the morning and suggested I went to the lavatory.   I have never gone to the lavatory before and was a bit afraid I'd miss out.  My aunty is a lovely person and it's not like I go out with her on a regular basis.  I usually just come home  with a tray of soap and water.  She suggested I ask her to take me out dancing if I was going to miss out on a night out.  I was going to ask my dad about  getting into a nightclub and if he was going I thought I'd ask him why  it took so long to get into a club.  I was going to tell you about my plan to go out with a girl I know and had a bit of a falling out with my ex-girlfriend.  It's not something I've really talked about with any new people and had a hard time coming to terms with how I felt about it.   I was going to ask you how things went down the last time we went out.  I didn't want to be a bother but I was so broke up over it all that I couldn't be bothered to get into the club.   I was going to ask you why you were so upset and why it was the least I could do was go out with a girl I know and have a good time.   My best friend from school is getting married June 25 and we're planning on getting married in a few months.   We'll still be young but I feel like I'm much closer now than I was when we broke up.   We'll still be in touch but I'm not going to spend all my time with you.   I love you guys but I'm not going to spend my life with you.      I love you all, but I'm not going to spend my time with you.         I love you guys love you, but I don't plan on spending my time with you.  I just one night.  I was going to ask you guys over there to have a meeting with your dad and you guys and your mum and I wanted to  a few  you guys  met your parents.  we'll be over for the first time.

            "I appreciate your reasonable caution with this proposal.   If your child is a legal resident of  England, or Wales, their parents should have received instructions setting  up that country to receive the E.B. (see below).   However, because this is a UK initiative, our  legal representatives are in the difficult position of explaining to non-UK  legal residents that this initiative is only for them, and they must be  subject to the same stringent registration, reporting and financial management requirements as  resident  England, Wales or Scotland.  We have already had two legal residents  who quit because of this requirement, and we cannot start from scratch.  You have been  very helpful in resolving this issue.   I now have instructions that will direct my team  towards how we need to resolve this issue.  We need to have a solid plan B in place ASAP so that our  legal team can focus fully and impartially on this issue.   This legal resident has never been a  part of the Enron family, and we do not want to turn that around.  By default, they are no longer legal residents of  England, so any changes in their status will be temporary,  and they will get back to normal soon enough.   We need to ensure that they are filing their income tax returns  as soon as possible, to be completed in time to participate in  the FE country exchange program.  They will be  required to file that return no later  than January 27, and we want to start preparing for that date before then.   We need to determine, from our limited  evidence, that the UK legal resident will have a hard  time making it through the January 27 transition, and we may never see them  again.   If you and  your family are interested in meeting with this individual, or in  following up on his previous contacts, please contact me ASAP so that we can continue working on this  issue.    This individual is very interested in pursuing a J-1 visa, and we need to get  something done before that process is complete.  I would prefer to meet\n",

The Late Favour of my client, after his Death, was made out to be paid in kind to the tune of 16.315 million United State Dollars (US$16.315M).However, after we got the money to 16.315 million, the Benin Government came to our rescue and asked us to release the money to them, without prior arrangement being made with me.  And so, I and other government officials, on instructions from the highest authorities in the Benin Republic, have already made arrangements with the banks here to process the money and had it in this country, before we knew about the disaster that befallen my country on 9-11-01.

            "I will call you again in about an hour,  to check on our electricity deal.  Apparently  this is another issue on which the two of you seem to agree,  that is,  the urgency of the particular transaction needs to be met before the due diligence step should be taken.  I was under the impression that you did not think the urgency would be significant,  that it would pass  without much notice.  In addition,  given the nature of the transaction, the due diligence steps seem to be unnecessary,  and there may be some administrative over take required before the due diligence steps are complete.  The transaction I believe you are referring to,  the pay as you go option, which I think should have been taken about 3 months ago,  and which I am now negotiating to try to get cancelled.  You and your team appeared to agree that the situation was very dicey, and there was a disconnect between the  facts and what the docs actually showed.  I will try to get a sign off from your general counsel about whether the deal should be frozen,  or something should be done to try to salvage it.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of contractors various times during the civilian dispensation. The original value of these contracts were executed to the tune of US$165,500,000.00 (166.500 million United State Dollars). The contracts were all awarded to two firms, one of which was actually awarded the contract, the other had its original value doubled to reflect in writing the transfer of the funds to the foreign account of the other firm. The original value of these contracts were then transferred into the foreign account of the contractor, who in turn, transferred the funds to his personal account in the United States.

            "I need some help getting my sister an internship at the university. Her college is in the Atlanta, GA area and she is currently studying for her Master's Thesis. I need to know as soon as possible so that I can get her started on her next step. My age is not an issue as I am starting to feel the anxiety of an older sibling. My response times on the phone and in person are generally very good.  My reservation is for when I am going to be away for the summer. That being said, I have not been the most active member of the family for many years.  I am 65 years old now and have been with the family for about a year.  I am currently involved in an adopt a family program in which we take in a family with a disability and help them get adjusted to our community.  It is a very young family and they are definitely family.   My sister is involved in a psychology program at Ercoles which is run by the local chapter of the Salvation Army.  She is very committed to the cause and has a passion for helping others.  She volunteers with various local groups in the area and in September will be taking psychology classes for the rest of her junior year at LSU.  At LSU she will be studying under Dr. Kenneth Mitchell.  If you are interested in contributing to this family, I would love to receive it.  Your donation will be tax-deductible.  Your donation is tax-deductible if it is sent to a church or charity that will take it from there. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do to help these families in the short amount of time they have.  Even if we could, there would still be a period of time in between when they need you the most and the taxman isnt going to let you do this just to please the government.  If you are interested in contributing, please contact me now to set up a time to help them during this time. They will of course need your donation to keep the electricity running in their area.   I can also help them with an offer for a summer job placement if you are interested in contributing.  This family is sponsored by the local chapter of the Salvation Army and they are helping this family get set up.  If you are interested in contributing, you must be at least 18 years of age and able to contribute to the project.  You must be able to contribute at least $1000 per month for the family.\n",

            "I appreciate your concern for my well-being.  Unfortunately, my health is beyond  salvage.  Not only has your worry about my well-being contributed to my unhappiness,  it has also hindered my ability to do my job with care and concern for others.  My days as a trader in CRE's real estate market are numbered.   You have always shown concern for me and my family, even when things didn't go your way.  You have always believed in my abilities and have worked hard to earn that confidence.  I owe you that.  My goal as your employer is  to provide a high-quality, reasonable job to an employee with a passion for the   trading business.  This is very different than what I ever believed was the case.   I was an energetic, confident young man eager to please my boss and improve my   position in life.  That is not the case anymore.   I wish I could help people  with my positive energy and optimism.  That is what really matters.   I am  not interested in arguing with people about what is or isn't a good time to  go to school, or what my schedule is like.  Those things don't matter when I get involved in a fight with my boss, or when I feel like giving money to my  estranged wife.   I would never do those things.   Instead, I try to help people  with issues in their lives, usually through positive reinforcement in the form of a constructive criticism.   My hope is that this new relationship will help  people make peace with their problems and move on from bitterness to love.   I have always wanted to be your partner and co-worker, not your enemy.   I hope we can find a positive energy in this relationship that will help  people to heal and stay positive.   If you feel that I'm not serious about the fight, maybe you would be interested in discussing this with  someone else.  I would love to be your partner and co-worker, but I need to focus on this fight.   I need  to focus on this fight and on my schoolwork first.  I need to focus on my schoolwork because this weekend will be critical in my preparation for the SAT test.  My co-worker Paul is taking the ACT to LSAT prep and also took the ACT to get into the SPRINT program.   We will need to have our work cut\n",

I got your contact from the World Trade Centre in Johannesburg South Africa. The World Trade Center is a hub for transfer of money through  diplomatic means. We discovered over the years that some of the top officials of the African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have been driven out of the bank since no man has been able to  remove them from office. This left us with the problem of how to transfer the money to a safe account abroad. To this end, we have in our  control the sum of USD$15 Million (Fifteen million united state dollars).We are now in  the bank's waiting room awaiting instructions to move the funds out of the South African.   Please note that this transaction is hitch free and absolutely risk free. There is practically no risk involved because all the documents covering the deposit  are with the South African Reserve Bank (S.A.B).   If you are interested, please reply to my private and confidential mail: (joe_mokoena@fastermail.com) for further instructions or call me on my private number: +27-83-509-7661.

I can  see where he is now, and I know he will be a  big help in the future.  I am leaving from work, and I am coming home  early, so I am not going to spend too much time with him because I am only going to be  going to dinner and a movie.

In the mean time, please review the attached card and tell me  that you agree to the conditions of the settlement. I am very sorry that this has been a stressful past two weeks for  me and our son.  Since we made the offer  on Friday, we have been discussing whether or not to accept it.  My wife is very upset about not receiving any reply  from her in the UK.  We will be sending an overseas  delivery member to collect our belongings.  Our  son will be 18 months old.  Please try to let me know as soon as possible if you agree to  the settlement and what your plans are for the rest of the tourney season. I need to  plan to get back to the settlement asap because the tourney is just around the corner.  Also, I just received a call  from my friend in the UK who is  interested in meeting us for lunch or dinner to settle the score.  We need to get this straightened out  with our UK correspondent ASAP so that we can send the payment to him.  You  can reach me at either my  home or at work.  I need  to get this straightened out very, very soon.   Please advise on what  to expect and try to let me know as  soon as possible if we will be able to settle this out.   Thanks.\n",

The policy of the finance company is that such a transaction will be thoroughly investigated and found wanting, to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

            "I have spoken to the person who originally laid the business card out to receive the money. She wanted to put it in a safe place so that  it wouldn't be misused.  As soon  as we receive the money we will send it to her.  Unfortunately, the place she  wanted to send the check to was in disarray due to the fire.  She was calling the store owner to get the address of the depository.  Unfortunately, the owner was out of the office  today so we had to send the check directly to his office.  It is his sincere pleasure.  He is very upset about not receiving the money  he paid for this weekend.  He called earlier in the week and said he would give them  a call to get the transaction tax credit.  Unfortunately, this is not an item on  the hotlist so he is  unable to make the call right now.  He may want to go to Woodbury  today and beg them to expedite the matter.  Meanwhile, we want to make sure the issue is not left for later   On Saturday, June 7.  That is when the real work begins.  We want to identify who our biggest customers are and figure out  how we can cut their business off of the list.  It is important to our long term future  plans that our natural gas contracts are in place to benefit our  customers.  We need to cut through the red tape in the natural gas  world to make that happen.  It is important that we have you on   Redbook ASAP so that we can get this off of the  calendar.  We have also identified 5-40 customers who may get screwed if  the above transaction is finalized.  These customers pay a huge price in lost sales and cash  deficits due to the above-referenced unfavorable swap data.  These customers pay the ultimate price in  diesel trade-ins and maintenance outages.   We need to identify and handle these outages  quickly in order  to provide our long term strategy in place to maximize head off the negative CTC implications   that  will result from this potential transaction.     We need to identify and patch-up these customers current hot links and waitlists in order to ensure that they remain relevant as the negative CTCA&M winds down.  we head to AP has.  move toward zero tolerance and zero tolerance.  These customers become more frequent.  This\n",

            "Thank you so much for the urgent help. I actually just got a new offer from the head of GE who is interested in  opening branches in your area.  Unfortunately, he is only interested in  GE contractors.  I have been told by a GE renter that his income is too great to accept the GE offer and  I have to go to work for free.  How are my options?  If you are interested, please contact me.  If your not,  contact another banker or ask  someone  else.  It is very unfair that after  signing a lease for a new building, we don't start moving stuff  around until the lease ends.  It is very confusing because we  originally signed a lease with GE but changed our minds and are trying to get a new  lease.  The new building is much bigger and much older than the old one.  It is quite a ways from my house so I can't  remember exactly how many months in.  I remember being picked up at the airport a couple of weeks ago because my sister was having a  baby and my mom took care of me.  I was actually in the car with  my  girlfriend at the time when this all happened.  It is really hard to fathom but it is really not my place to  complain.  I was pretty messed up because of all the drama that was going on in my life at that time.  Basically, I am trying to get my life together so that I can be with  my girlfriend asap so that I can get this all out of my system and let it all sink in to the  real world.  Unfortunately, all of this has a way of making me anxious and worrying about things that I can't control like I used to.  My whole world is very dark and depressing and I get very anxious when I am not using it.  trying to come to terms with you about the negative emotions.  things in my life.  It really it.  And it really, it just breaks my world is really hard to come to believe that I was a point now that I have let go back to dealing with the negative stuff I am.  with the negative and I had to this is still using it.  I am.  this bad habit of doing it.  It takes a lot of not using the media has really hard to keep me.  I thought process. It really  part of trying to get it and to the negative. But\n",

On June 6, 1996, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Department of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds in a bank here in Nigeria so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be kept aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:megan_zuba01@yahoo.com Thanks and my regards. Dr.Mohammed Zuba\n",

I will take a couple of days off to visit your family and  then we will be back on Monday.  Hope you can forgive me for  not being able to get back to you with the results of the  tests I have had ordered.  I have notified the  insurance company regarding this issue and they will help  you as best they can.  You have been wonderful. I am very thankful  and very appreciative.

I still have to pay the phone  bill and that is a lot to  take on.  My son has had a hard  time adjusting to life in the  present.  We will get along great medical bills  and will probably even  have some free  lunch on Sunday.  I am very excited about getting out of  here  and starting over.

My bank noticed this and went through some old files to find out who the deceased may have died with. I discovered that the deceased had no next of kin and that is why I am contacting you to assist in receiving this money into your account. If you accept to assist me and make application that will make you the next of kin to the deceased. I will need you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the next of kin.

We are still paying off the student loans that our eldest child took on, as well as our oldest son's medical school loan.  Fortunately our oldest son is not nearly as dependent on student loans as he was at age 15, and we have been making some fairly decent monthly deposits into our son's account.  We have also added in a couple of lines of credit, one with a term of one year and the other that is term-only.  While these are not ideal, they work well in the short term to try to build some equity in our family.\n",

            "        I have been inundated with e-mails from concerned Citizens objecting to the draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the Alamo Drafthouse's request to build a new $100 million dollar building.  We have always said that we would not build the proposed $200 million dollar building (the tallest building in Houston) unless we had first made a decision about the $50 million dollar building (the smallest).  I would like to discuss with you asap ASAP how we would make that decision.  It needs to be 100% certain that we would not be in violation of the Houston Compromise or the State of Texas Climate Change Program.  I'd like to discuss asap with your group as we are in the midst of developing the EIR, which will be submitted to the full EPA by the ALAMO DEVELOPMENT GROUP this week.  Once the decision is made on the EPA request, we will take another look at the request and, if necessary, amend it.  Once the revised request is approved, we will send the new revised request to the full EPA and, if necessary, file documents to back up our position.  Then, we will take another look at the revised request and, if necessary, file documents to back up our position.  It's important to us that Houston is developing capacity and that the EPA is monitoring this request closely.  The revised request does not do enough to tell us when it will be time to close this deal.  The new deal the EPA is negotiating requires additional information to complete the 60 days since the last deal was signed.  The EPA has informed us that the next step is to fax all of the information we received from the previous deal to the EPA for inclusion in the final product.  This would mean that by the EPA deadline of 3 p.m. on Friday, we would have missed the deadline by a total of 60 days.  I was disappointed in this latest attempt to close the deal, as it was very vague and the terms were very restrictive.  I would like to discuss with you ASAP on how we would fill out the gaps in your group's schedule and, if needed, add on another day or two to keep this project on schedule.  My schedule is very flexible and AP starts on Wednesday, so I would like to get this in before the big monster on my schedule and see if the kids can come to us any of it.   I have time crunch time constraints\n",

I have the authority of my account holder (Late) who died from the Sierra Leone epidemic. Before his death he made a will and gave to me all his property, which includes his bank account, which he declared to be $10m (ten million united state dollars)to my knowledge no other person has claimed it nor will anyone ever come forward to claim it. The government is not aware of this account because my mission is not allowed by law to be able to visit the country at the moment. A company director who has been in this business for a long time and died quietly from a heart attack in April last year told me recently that the government will not allow any British or American company to claim this account because the owner will be buried alive if he does not claim it urgently. I have been told by my account director in the past that if I do not claim this account urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. If this is the case please reply to my private and confidential box: (mariama_olela@yahoo.co.uk) for further directives of how we can move the money out of the Country immediately.

            "Dear Bobby:   My dear brother in law passed away a few days ago.  My thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time.  We are doing well.  My mother is back in the life and I am  doing very well as well.  I have been going to the doctor and up to 12 different specialists to try and find a cure.   I finally gave birth to a son yesterday which was rough but it was worth it.  I will write again tomorrow and hopefully find a cure I can send a picture of.   I love you all very much and will miss you all much.   My Dad is moving to Houston soon and it has been great to see how he has changed.  He is staying with my mother in law in the old  house which has always been a comfort and refuge for us.  The views you guys provide are always beneficial to the cause and I am  grateful for your kind words.  Please feel free to contact me with questions,  concerns, or requests.  I will do my best to help resolve any problems you may have.  You guys rock!  Love,  Maria       x57334=81825\n",

            "Dear Fred  Adoh:  I told you earlier that I would be pleased to talk only on Saturday.  You should expect to hear from me on Monday.  If you have a call by then, please let me know.  I am taking a vacation from work commencing January 3rd.  My son has decided to take his first vacation ever.  I will be out of the loop from Monday to Thursday.  Sounds as though his school year is fairly new and much less stressful than his last year at alma.  We only have one car though.  \n",

            "I just returned from a trip to Italy as that is where my son is now and we only have one child to take to school (kiddo is six months old).  Our trip was completely on hold because of a medical emergency two weeks ago.  I am so glad that your son called 2 weeks ago and said that he is interested in going to the doctor.  He said that he wants to see if there are any  other doctors or other programs that are  available that will help him.  I have to admit that I have been pretty much keeping quiet about my son's medical needs.  I have been out of the loop on a family basis as our nieces are having their  children diagnosed with a rare pediatric bone  fracture.  We are without power for about a week now and were without it for about two months because of a power outage.  My wife has recently started getting some health reports and has determined that our son is definitely on his parents  insurance and should receive some sort of compensation.  She says that his premium has increased by $100 since our last  insurance payment and we are raising children together and it is tough  to keep up with the monthly payment.  We are doing OK on the insurance front.  My oldest son just turned 19 and is in his senior year at  Southern Methodist University.  He is now the target of a new hate crime targeting Jewish people.  Our first act as mayor of  Dallas is going to be to put an end to the constant  demonstrations that are taking place all over the city.  I will be  meeting with the ADEQ today and  will be releasing the  figures related to carbon monoxide and other  emergencies to try and put a stop to this growing  problem.  It is very concerning to see the level of hatred  directed at our police officers and the damage that this city  has already done.    I have been in contact\n",

            "I need immediate assistance with an urgent matter. The principal at the school I work for has threatened my safety if I don't cooperate with his demand that I turn over my hard drive. He said that he will \"find a way\" to get my hard drive but I don't know how or how dangerous it is becoming. I have received a lot of threatening phone calls and telegrams regarding this issue. I have been called a terrorist, a Nazi, a pervert, a child molester and a slumlord. I have been the victim of several attempts to rape me, but I have prevailed in every attempt and have overcome them all. I would like to suggest that you set up a meeting for one or two minutes to exchange views on ways to resolve this problem. I have never been violent or a threat to anyone, but I am a peaceful person who wants to cooperate with everyone and to live my life to the fullest. If you feel that I'm not cooperating and would be a menace to everyone else, then you need to tell me. I need to know so that I can withdraw from the meeting. If you don't have time to meet today, then please don't try to bully me into it. If you insist, then I need you to propose something concrete that you think I can do. I need concrete evidence that you think I'm not cooperative and there will be consequences. If you don't have that, I need evidence that you think I'm dishonest and that you think I'm a threat to other people. I need to know so that I can withdraw from the meeting. There's no time to lose.       Mr. Mike Gallagher\n",

            " Business Invitation From Mr.David Grae Nice to receive your urgent message after a short time. I am Mr.David Grae, currently Director of Private Banking Services with a Bank in Singapore. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an American miner, Mr. Dave Graham made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for fourteen (14) calendar months, valued at US$14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, United Mine Workers United States that Mr.Dave Graham died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dave Graham did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of $14,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expences both parties might have incurred in the course of the transaction.If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond immediately via my private email and upon your agreement, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax  mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply Delete\n",

            "I need your assistance with Tanya's child. My son is five and a half and she is expecting his twentieth child on June the 1st. My work is very demanding and requires me to be available for every call and meeting with clients. I cannot leave the house at night due to my commitments, so I need to be available to meet with clients immediately. I cannot begin to fathom the demands placed on me by clients, parents, and siblings alike. At times, it is overwhelming. I have lost count of the number of times I have cried, wailed, or yelled at my computer screen, for no apparent reason other than stress. At other times, it has been the opposite; I have found solace in the fact that I have been called upon to care for ailing siblings, or to look after a sick parent. Simply put, I have been called upon to do both jobs. What has prevented me from doing these jobs fully, and what exactly do I lose out on if my obligations are not fulfilled?\n",

I want them to have a better life, not only financially, but also in life. I want them to have the opportunities and the freedom to make mistakes and to grow. I do not want them to be victims, I want them to be leaders in their fields. Not only that, I want them to be able to help me and my family as they did in the past.

            " MATT BUNDU VERY URGENT ATTN: SIR/CEO, I am MR.MATT BUNDU, Assistant Director of Western Union (Western Union) Asia Pacific business and finance department. This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, South African Export Promotion Council that Mr.Matt Burton died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Matt Burton did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Matt Burton so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately you Telephone number, Account Number, and private e-mail address where I can lodge your family business and other requirements. 2. I will like you to respond immediately with your full names and address to this mail. 3. I will want you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number for easy communication. 4. Send also your full names and address to enable me file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before i could proceed on the transfer to your account.

            " My name is Michael Nelson and I am currently applying to become a Contract Pharmacist/Medical Doctor.  I was referred to you by Betty Cox, MD, FACCS.  I have been accepted into Tulane University School of Pharmacy where I will be working towards my Pharmacy degree in the spring of 1997.  I will be completing my program in the fall and will be leaving in the fall, so I have time to start working on my Master's in Clinical Pharmacy.  I have started my first semester  with the same professor as my predecessor.  We have very similar grading and grading criteria, so I am  assuming that you were not the only one who felt that you were not fitting in here.   Your name is not on the honor roll any longer, but I  think you deserve an award for your efforts.  I hope you can continue to help in any way that you can.   Also, I would like to inform you that I am no longer working for Western Union and am now working for Mastercard.  If you were wondering why  we are  not using Western Union for international transfers, now you know why.  You will get  very cold feet if you bring money here.  You have no idea how much it has cost us over the phone over the past couple of months.  We are very conservative people, and  sometimes that means we have to pinch ourselves because we don't have a lot of other options.   I was very upset about not having received an answer before Christmas.   I thought it would be a good time to ask you why you were  not using Western Union for those transactions.  Also, I was not sure if I would be able to participate in some of the activities  that you had planned for the trip because I was working part-time  and had to look for a job.   You must have heard, or seen, that I was able to join  something called The Tulane Alumni Foundation.   This is a non-profit corporation that raises money for both schools and gives  back to the community in some small  way.   My hope is that we can help in the search for a cure  for some  common  disease or a way to keep people on a little more  realistic  economic  expenses.   Something I have been struggling with at the moment is whether I want to participate in some of the new team activities that  are new to\n",

Since then my mother left with her children (stuck) for (UNHCR in South Africa) Africa. I have decided to contact you because of the urgency of this transaction. My father was a shopper and he was also a diamond /cocoa dealer in Liberia. Before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some money (US$10.000.000.00) which he made on a business trip to (South Africa) through a diplomatic means, with a security company here in South Africa. He told me that this money was to enable him invest a good part of his life in your country. I want you to help me to lodge this consignment in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box and then forward it to you for safe keeping. He told me that the security company did not know the content of the box as it was unloaded and left at my disposal with the help of my husband's former assistant. This consignment has since been lodged in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box. However, the management at the Security Company told me that they did not know the content of the box as it was left there as a family treasure.

Is there anyway I can go to the  SEC prosecutor about wanting to be buried with my grandchild.   I have been living in New York for the past 8 months, and have moved back to L.A. two weeks ago.   I've decided to move back to L.A. with my wife and our three children as our first stopover.   I'll be out of the country for the rest of the summer, so I can't send my request to  the SEC for investigation.  Unfortunately, I don't have that much time remaining on my contract, so I can't request an immediate  pardon.  Even if I were an adult and could request a discretionary pardon, it would be very difficult to justify in writing.  It just would be a matter of  showing cause  and justifying my actions.  I can't do either of those things, unfortunately.   So, I am basically putting the legal fight I am having with the SEC behind me now.

I have narrowed down my list of  requests to three.

However, I assume that you are involved in the financials side of things,  so I would recommend going over  it again in the morning.   THe conference call will be around 3pm  Eastern Time, so if you could respond  quickly to this I'd be very appreciative.  Also, if there is any way that you could  share this with a friend, especially someone as  prominent as yourself.   My goal is to help people at risk,  both financially and socially.   I would love to do business with  you, but I need more information before I can make that happen.   Please have your phone and my address  handy, so that I know how to reach you.

Your proposed TFA in Enron City, Texas has been  heavily weighted toward Enron's preferred management team.   This management team includes former Enron Directors and Enron Security Officers.   I would be greatly appreciative if you would take this on as your personal  mission and devote all of your energies to it.   This would require a minimum commitment of time and energy that is not available  today.   Your proposed TFA in Houston, Texas has been heavily weighted to the side of Enron for several years now.   This team includes former Directors and Officers of Enron, as well as current and ex-Directors.   This team has the strongest financial base and the strongest management base possible, but unfortunately, is severely marred by  problems of its own making.    The business plan you have been working on is based on the premise that by December 31,  2000 the project should have a solid foundation in place to begin the  construction process of the Panama Canal.   If you could e-mail or fax me this along with a note as to how you plan to move things along, I would absolutely love to hear from you.   Unfortunately, there is  not much time left on this plan and the deadline has been pushed back to December Xmas.   I strongly suggest that you contact Robyn --- our Manager of Engineering Relations --- immediately to get your project moving along asap and as part of your larger larger larger strategy.   Remember, we are NOT looking for a quick fix here.  We want a true multi-year plan that will enable us to truly benefit from the  services that our individuals and small business have to offer.   Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this initiative,  or if you would like to discuss any of the issues raised by this initiative with your Group Equity Manager.    The opportunity to work with industry leading technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! is  an invaluable asset to have in place if we want to build a strong foundation for our  business.

The head of the company,Bernadette Le Dain,  has been involved in a business dispute with the chief executive officer of the company,Thomas More.    When BNP was incorporated in 1997, its legal name was simply 'Bernadette Nhan' and its trading name was simply 'BNP Capital Markets'.   However, in April this year, BNP changed its name to simply 'Brooks Group'.    Since then, the business dealings of BNP have been disrupted by a number of events, most notably the listing of the company on the Toronto Stock Exchange in August and a succession of business failures, both financial and human resources matters, which have affected the viability of the company and the management team.   This situation has led to a significant change in the culture and procedures of the business and, as a result, it is in dire need of assistance.    The leadership team of BNP is, without doubt, the finest group of people in the entire world.   I am confident that your talents and experience will be of great assistance to this organization.

He is currently on an accelerated three year path.   After completing his program, he will be entering the same position that he was in as a student at the university.  He hopes to one day work for  Enron and become a part of history.   My apologies for any of you that are  experiencing this right now.  It  sounds as though your son has really stepped up at this stage in his career.\n",

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an entire portfolio valued at US$19,500,000.00 (Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into one of the leading private Banks here in South Africa.  Upon maturity, the Funds was decleared Unsatisfied and was subsequently conveyed back to the Bank without the knowledge of the public or the bank.

After some Googling, I discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did  not actually declare any next of kin in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to present your choice as next of kin or relation of the deceased;  if you so wish, I will introduce my family to you personally and settle down here in the United States.

I am aware that a meeting with you will set us both apart and after due talks,  we can settle down and have dinner together, after which you can handle  the funds in the bank while I will accompany you to the meeting place.  The fee for this transaction is two million five hundred thousand United  States dollars (US$2.5M)and two million five hundred thousand United  States Dollars.  I have the funds in the bank and have ruled out any payment policy as  unworkable. If you accept to work with me, you must give me 20% of the total funds,  2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction,  3% for your personal use, and 5% for the establishment fee.

            " For the record, I have your wife's address and we (Ms. Arif and I) moved into an apartment complex about 3.5 hours north of my house on Tuesday, September 20.  I thought that you might be interested in our rental agreement. Apparently, Ms. Arif and her family moved here from Saudi Arabia about a year ago.  My wife and I (Ms. Arif and I) were originally from Egypt and we moved here about a year ago.  We're originally from California but our area codes are actually pretty minor so we originally thought that we were moving to Southern California.  But Ms. Arif is originally from Saudi Arabia and our area codes are really big so we originally thought that she was going to California.  And she is originally from Utah so our area codes are actually pretty big too.  So, I guess her new area code is a big deal because her new home is located in an area where CA does not have enough power for its population density to support an independent power plant.  We originally planned on starting up the plant back in September but Ms. Arif's visa condition (you heard me right) called for us to wait until January 2, which was absolutely unthinkable because the plant would be operational back then.  Finally, Ms. Arif's visa called for us to put the plant up for auction which was completely out of the question because Ms. Arif is a citizen of a different country and our country doesn't recognize her new nationality.  We finally put the plant up for auction last week so that's why Ms. Arif is in the situation she is in (a crappy one, actually, but that's another story).  Anyway, she is technically our subleasee but she is really our landlord (he bought the unit from us 6 months ago).\n",
            " Ms. Arif seems to be living in a one-bedroom apartment on $600 per month (estimate).  We finally sold our last sublet and moved into a one-bed flat on $900 per month (a full month's rent for a one bedroom apartment complex).  We originally thought that maybe we could negotiate a little better sublet if we offered her some equity in exchange for the right to keep her on the lease (which we could have done if we had offered her some cash).  Maybe we could have offered some sort of equity loan (like a down payment schedule that she can't prepay downshift into) or some sort of loan insurance\n",

This program is very different from the traditional business strategy that is typically employed.   It is based on the concept of \"assumed control\", which is the opposite of \"controlling\".   It is the antithesis of the classic managing-by-committee approach.   It is the opposite of collaborative thinking and is very difficult to sustain over time.   The key to sustain this approach, as with many aspects of business, is a skill set and a commitment to keep improving each and every day.   You need to show your skills and be committed to continuing to improve them.   This is why it is so important that you show yourself to be an active part of the process and positively contributing member of the solution.  \n",

            " From Mr. Al Nizami ATTN: I must solicit your confidence in this transaction that is of mutual benefit and urgency of life in general. I am contacting you concerning a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account in our Bank. The said money was a result of a contract awarded by the bank for the goods and services supplied by the bank during the year 2004. The contract was supposed to the construction of a new steel plant in China and the actual cost of the project was over invoiced to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$130,000,000.00 (thirty united state dollars). The actual cost was US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars).  The owner of the account, a Chinese Nationality with a Permanent Address residing in the United State of America, with a Bank Name as above, has for his personal safety and the security of my family, advised against travelling out from the country for investment purposes. I have therefore contacted you to assist my family in investment in your country.  I have the possibility to invest a total of 10,000,000.00 (ten million five hundred thousand United States dollars) in your country under your proper management and care. The money will be paid for us by you after you have helped my family to secure a foreign account where the fund will be deposited, and also secured a necessary agreement with a foreign security company to provide legal cover for the release of the fund once it has been lodged in your custody. I wish to note that this transaction is risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance though,I am ready to give you a commission of 20% of the total money for your assistance, and 2% for the services of other part of your family. Finally I want you to keep 15% of the total money for your assistance, and 5% for the expenses the transaction might occasion in the course of the business.  I expect your urgent response back to enable us finalise this issue as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, BARRISTER AL NIZAMI\n",

PLEASE OPEN FAX NUMBER:+27-73-424-81-16 ATTN:SIR/CEO Dear Friend, I have a business proposal that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. This is not a rumour and it is not a hoax. There is a business in my country,  worth about USD$12 million (Twelve million United States Dollars)and i the owner of that business,  (A miner) in our country (U. A. E) are involved in a contract with a foreign Contract Review Panel that is due to be awarded in October 2002.  The contract was executed in 1997 and paid to our company for construction of a pulp and paper mill at our site in South Africa. The contract was supposed to be awarded to a foreign contractor to the tune of USD$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the funds was adjusted to reflect the difference in assessed value between the two contractors. We discovered in 1999 that the contract was not being paid and finally we discovered in 2002 that the contract has been pay by different contractors and that the contract has been awarded to a company wholly owned by one of our foreign Contractors without our knowledge or consent. This sum of USD$12 million has been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by the Federal Government of Nigeria for almost three years now.

            " URGENT CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE  FROM: BRIAN FUSUAMU. PLEASE OPEN FAX NUMBER:+27-73-424-81-16 ATTN:SIR/CEO Dear Friend, I have a business proposal that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. This is not a rumour and it is not a hoax. There is a business in my country,  worth about USD$12 million (Twelve million United States Dollars)and i the owner of that business,  (A miner) in our country (U. A. E) are involved in a contract with a foreign Contract Review Panel that is due to be awarded in October 2002.  The contract was executed in 1997 and paid to our company for construction of a pulp and paper mill at our site in South Africa. The contract was supposed to be awarded to a foreign contractor to the tune of USD$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the funds was adjusted to reflect the difference in assessed value between the two contractors. We discovered in 1999 that the contract was not being paid and finally we discovered in 2002 that the contract has been pay by different contractors and that the contract has been awarded to a company wholly owned by one of our foreign Contractors without our knowledge or consent. This sum of USD$12 million has been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by the Federal Government of Nigeria for almost three years now.  In order to transfer the money out of country, I need to have  you as the beneficiary and next of kin. I have the money in a security company and this is the information that you are required to provide. I will arrange for the money to leave the country and be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition for peaceful purposes to further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general.

I am a Director of the Bank of the African Development Bank Cape Town South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant, i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with my government attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Yours sincerely, Mr.Mohamed Ibor\n",

            "We would love to do business with you.  Unfortunately, our (probably short) time line on this transaction is very short.  You have been referred to me by an Intereoretty broker-dealer who is very promising and has excellent relationships with a number of international financial institutions.  Our goal is to convince  these folks that we can deliver on our time  line.  Unfortunately, our time line is very long.   In fact, our time  line is much shorter than the one-year deadline.   We have started negotiating with these folks and we intend to move  this process along very quickly.   This process should be completed by the end of the  first week of June.   However, due to the urgency of this transaction, certain co-ordinates and information has been  lost due to the transition.  To return to our original time line, we need your comments and  suggestions on how we can make this process flow in a less  intensive manner.  It is my hope that the more immediate concerns can be mitigated or  eliminated in the interim.   As we have discussed, I would like to keep the original 1/2 mile time line  with an urgent revision to it.   This revision needs to be in place no later than June 2013.   This way, we get our wish granted and we still have  some flexibility in the event that we lose money.   An urgent revision to the settlement we have already made with the ADEA would  be in order before June.     However, due to the urgency of this transaction, I have to propose to  you today and you have until Monday to make your decision.   If you decide to accept the revision to the settlement,  then you will have until early July to approve the revised agreement.      If, on the other hand, you decide to reject the proposed changes, then you will  have until August to do so.    The proposed revisions to the settlement should be in place no sooner  than August 13.     This way, we avoid any \"ifs\" and \"buts\" about the  appropriate timeline.      I hope you and your family are doing well.  I will contact you shortly  with further information regarding the Hebert Report.    - Dan  x3-0977      \n",

Attn:Managing Director We are currently in need of an assistance from a foreign partner who could assist us in investing and doing the business in our country for forty (40) years. There are certain numbers on an international file that if transferred to his country would make him the owner of the funds. This is because the Act of Transfer of the funds was not done in accordance with the customs and laws of the respective countries where this bank is located. The Act of Transfer of the funds was made possible when the then President of the Republic of Cote D' Ivoire, General Sani Abacha, who is currently in exile to the Republic of Senegal, made arrangement with a German business commitee to transfer out $30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United State Dollars only) from my bank here in Nigeria. This money was meant for his election campaign and the maintenance of the National Democratic party in the country.      As a public servant still in active government service, I cannot acquire this money in my country. I therefore took it upon myself to go into active business in your country.    As a matter of fact, the success or non-success of this business depends entirely on the personality and capacity of the foreign partner that comes to receive the fund. If you are interested in this project, send the name and address as stated below. I shall then furnish you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

I have therefore, sought your assistance in the transfer of the fund to your account. I have the authority of my manager and two other top officials to request that you should present your self as the beneficiary to the fund to enable us transfer into your account the fund 30% of the total sum. You should furnish me immediately with your phone number,firm's name or any alias so that I can use your confidential telephone and fax number to conduct the necessary procedures. I have also decided to give you 20% of the total sum for all your assistance, I hope this is the right decision for you. Please, I appreciate the urgency of this transaction.

I am interested in investing in your country into a very lucrative business as a result of the fact that I noticed during my home search that you have a close business relationship with a foreigner (a Chinese National) who is also a potential business man. During my tenure in my department, we discovered in one of our Special Compartments that a sum of US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-six Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars) was lodged in a dormant account in my Bank without any claim of the fund as the owner and the account had no other beneficiary. The money was lodged as a family valuable and a matter of pride for my department as we all know that investment in your country will yield more money on the return investment than sitting on the fund.  I contacted my private contact and through the goodwill of God he has led me to believe that the only thing we need from God in this life is to give us the assurance that we shall be protected from all kinds of  devils and spirit here after. I am now soliciting for your assistance to invest this fund in your country and also for you to help me see that my family and I come to a peaceful and successful conclusion.  If you can be of God fearing and willing to assist me, I will like you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number. I shall rely on you  unconditionally and ask that you leave no stone unturned in this business. If this proposal satisfies you, please respond immediately via my email and upon your agreement the next business day. I want to assure you that this transaction is totally risk free as I got your contact from business directory located in the Internet.  You will also be entitled to 20% of the entire fund on final conclusion of this business for your assistance. Endeavor to act swiftly as all the paperwork in this transaction will be done by me. I have decided to part with 25% of the total fund for your assistance, while 75% will be for my family investment in YOUR country as soon as every precaution is completed.

            " FROM MRS FARAH AL-HAMEDI FROM MRS FARAH AL-HASHEMI Address, No 10, TAYO RIMI, LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear Friend, My name is Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi, the wife to the late Major General al-Hasshemi a.k.a. \"The Cobra\" who was in charge of the transfer of funds during the Gulf War. During my husband's time in the office, he was also in-charge of the payment of the military salary during his life service time . During my husband's tenure as the leader of the Gulf War, I witnessed many of the atrocities committed by the rebels and many others. During my husband's time in the office, I learnt that some of the money that my late husband deposited in a security company during the war was not actually the total amount involved, but a portion that was meant for my son's future investment in your country or anywhere else in the world. After going through some of the records, I noticed that some of the documents that was deposited in the security company belong to my late husband. After going through the records, I discovered that my late husband did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the bank. This amount of US$9.9M (Nine million United States dollars) was actually Deposited in the bank as family valuables, and the authorisation papers for this deposit were signed by my late husband's family attorney and approved by the bank board before the funds were finally released. In order to avoid any family relation from being affected by the release of the funds, I will write to- some of the family relations who will be interested in this transaction are as follows; [1] Mr. Daniel  Hosseini [2] Mr Shoaib al-Hashemi [3] Mr Nasser al-Hashemi [4] From  Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi. I hope that this fund can be released and spent in your country or anywhere else where it will be needed most. Kindly please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free (provided you keep utmost secret). I await your urgent reply to enable us finalise the transaction within a strict deadline. Yours Sincerely. Mrs Farah al-Hashemi\n",

            "Apologises we have changed the business procedures and/or processes so that the above agreement cannot be effective because  it is signed by attorneys acting on behalf of Transco.  Please review this, if it is not in effect please return immediately and we will resubmit  this as agreement at a later date.  This is a case in point, as we discussed extending the deadline to Dec. 1 to March 31 which is very problematic becasue its in effect  until the 1st of December.  This is not a situation where we have ``to do this, they do that, why shouldn't we make the rules retroactive to give them a fighting chance at the  fee schedule they chose,'' etc.  Simply by signing this document, both sides have committed  to doing business in accordance with the non-compete clause of the agreement.  This provision is very clear and  positive in nature and is intended to encourage free  exchange of ideas and information.  The counter parties intention was clearly to  quash any attempt at a settlement that does not include this provision.  This is a huge win for the  parties, and i am sure many others as well.  This is a big win for us as the longer we wait to resolve this the  more it will cost us in lost business and frustration.  I was right there with  you when you first identified this issue.  I can't remember exactly where, but from what i can gather we wanted to  avoid arbitration at all costs.  This is a significant win for consumers,  and i think for everybody involved.  The non-aggression pact  was going to be a big win for consumers since they would be able to choose their  provider of  energy, and it is a major factor in their economics.  By striking the non-aggression pact they  agreed to not use force if necessary to resolve disputes, and they also committed  to working towards a  settlement that promotes the free exchange of ideas and information.  This may be their biggest win yet, and if  things don't go their way i would go to war with them.  As it is currently  contemplated they will make a payment to Alamo in March and its  implications on our position in light of the non-aggression pact.  Its hard to believe, but  it was actually the other party that struck the non-aggression pact  and they really had nothing to gain or lose by not doing so.  Now\n",

Since his death, I have made various enquiries to various Embassies to locate any of my dead parents and this has also proved unsuccessful. After a very unsuccessful attempt, I am now determined to locate any of my dead parents. I have made some diligent searches and found the first tranche of money which my late father left behind me in an embassy vault. The money is USD$10 Million (Ten million United States dollars), and I have decided tol register it in my name as the beneficial owner to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the money to a security company in Singapore for the safe keeping of the money in a well-established and reputable company there to enable the bank to commense the transfer to your account in your country without delay and also to enable you claim the money on my behalf since I have been refused a bank account in my country. I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free as the money will be safe in the security company as my foreign partner have all the necessary documents and keys to the security company in Singapore, where the deceased had an account valued US$10 Million. As soon as I hear from you, I will then furnish you with the details of the transaction. I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free because I have taken care of all arrangements with the security company in Singapore, as all the documents and proof of the transaction will be with the security company upon my request.

I discovered that the deceased ($25,000,000.00) was a customer of Wein'et AG, a leading oil and gas consulting and advisory firm in Europe, who died among other things in an Air crash along with his wife on the Nigerian Airline Rafale  aircraft on the 21st October 2000.

This bond has been around for many years now and it has worked fine for us, the board of directors have fine tune and over invoiced the money to the tune of $25million USD.

            "I appreciate your note and wish to discuss the issue of family leave now that the child has been returned to us.  I would like to put this in writing ASAP so that we can work out the settlement.  My mom and dad are both working two full-time jobs and have a few months left on their contracts.  Unfortunately, their schedules are very limited and if you were available to tend to the child you would take, then I would think that you would give it a shot.  Unfortunately, due to the child's age and special needs, I do not think that this is an optimal time to establish ourselves up front as parents would be necessary.

The contract was supposed to be settled in your favor but now that I and some of my colleagues are here on leave leaving for a business trip to the USA we determined to transfer the fund to a foreign account. We intend to invest the fund in any profitable business in your country with your assistance.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved in the award and review and the relevant document covering the award and review is with my colleague involved in the purchase. Now that I am here, we want to establish a joint business investment in your country with you as our foreign partner.  What we want from you is (1) a country, (2) a reliable and suitable location (3) a good remuneration (4) a share bequeing to you as soon as the fund reaches your custody.

            "I have been out of the office and have just seen what I believe to be a mistake on your end regarding the email you sent my way.   Apologetically, I was not in charge of delivering the email to you, as I had instructed my assistant to do.  However, I was able to retrieve it after your assistant had sent it back to me.   Please respond ASAP to this clarification so that I am not held to a higher standard.   Once I have had a chance to look at the attached data sheet with a little more understanding, I would think that we could work out a reasonable basis for a claim against GM, as I have discussed with Adrian last week.   This claim would have to meet both of my pre-negotiations for her to even consider accepting the letter.   Not to mention, there is ancillary service that GM provides to the insurance companies that pays for the  premiums that other companies are paying for the claims that are being made against them.   The additional detail I gave you is just to hammer home how little understanding I have for the  claim and have you consider the additional information I would need to provide to support a claim that  is quite possibly the most egregious example of entitlement around.   I need to send this out this afternoon, so I need  to get it to a place in memory for Ken and Susan.   Thanks for your help.   -----Original Message----- From: \tIbid.pdf  \n",

            " business proposition Dear Sir/Madam, I am Donald J. Otobo, a sierra Leonie and a member of the inter-country steering committee (C.I.O.C.) of the African Union (AU). I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the Africa am amerchant service. Your contact was sufficient to enable me contact you for this transaction, on a business transfer of a sum of $25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars) into your account. This was due to the fact that I discovered that your credit report does not indicate any known or living beneficiary, but instead has consistently shown me as the only natural person to have this particular account. I have sole discretion as to where and when this money should be released on the instruction of the bank, based on the dictates of my conscience. This is the position I found myself in, after spending some time online and over the Internet, after consulting my conscience, I decided to forward to you this business transfer, in the interest of good business partnership. We want you to assist us in transferring this money out of Dakar - Senegal, into a viable business venture in your country. All the documents covering this deposit and the production of the vital documents covering this deposit require a high degree of confidence. This is why I contacted you to assist me in this transaction.

            " business proposition Dear Sir/Madam, I am Donald J. Otobo, a sierra Leonie and a member of the inter-country steering committee (C.I.O.C.) of the African Union (AU). I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the Africa am amerchant service. Your contact was sufficient to enable me contact you for this transaction, on a business transfer of a sum of $25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars) into your account. This was due to the fact that I discovered that your credit report does not indicate any known or living beneficiary, but instead has consistently shown me as the only natural person to have this particular account. I have sole discretion as to where and when this money should be released on the instruction of the bank, based on the dictates of my conscience. This is the position I found myself in, after spending some time online and over the Internet, after consulting my conscience, I decided to forward to you this business transfer, in the interest of good business partnership. We want you to assist us in transferring this money out of Dakar - Senegal, into a viable business venture in your country. All the documents covering this deposit and the production of the vital documents covering this deposit require a high degree of confidence. This is why I contacted you to assist me in this transaction. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while 10% will be set aside for expenses and sharing as required by law in your country and internationally, as per our mutually agreed percentage. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email address:     info@sierralee-international.com. Please respect my privacy, as I await your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Donald J. Otobo\n",

            "I was out of the office on Monday, November 20.   I tried to give you an update on my  situation.   I have a conference call with this gentleman and his assistant on   Thursday.   I hope you were not  too  surprised to learn that my youngest child is engaged to be married   on September 20.  That would mean that my engagement is over September and the search for our   engagement ring will start September 25.   I was hoping that you could at least give me some update on what is holding  up our engagement ring deal.   Most recently, our engagement ring deal with the big 6 met with a major revamp.   I was not too thrilled with the new take on things, but it  looks like we are still on the right track.   I know that you were  very upset with me for taking the ring on this trip.   You wrote to me that  \"you were going to give the ring to  Mom\" and I responded that \"even if it costs $50,000,  I need it now.\"   Your tone was very  different that day than it would be a couple of weeks  later.   I want to  remind you how serious of a person I am.  I am not going to lie and tell you that I am not upset about the money.   I certainly wouldn't want to do  something stupid like that again.   I love you and you have always done a great job of supporting me.   Would it be appropriate to assume that we will be getting along fine in this relationship?   I cannot believe the out pour of help  that came my way.   My load has been lifted considerably, but I have not really felt the rush of emotions like you did.   I have a lot of unanswered questions that I want you to answer for me, but I also want you to know that we are still very different people.   I would like to get to the bottom of exactly what steps I have to take to get exactly what I want,  and I don't want to do that by beating around the bush for you.   I was hoping that we could work out an amicable way to split the money and get it  remitted to me by the time you get this letter.   As it is right now, I just want to work out an exit strategy to use if we don't make a decision\n",

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing you in respect of United Bank for Africa (UBA). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.  On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Taylor made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. David Taylor died from a car accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Taylor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction and the remaining 20% is for each beneficiary,whichever is greater. If you are interested,please reply immediately to my private and confidential fax number as above. Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documentsthat will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via fax  and letter mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential fax number as well.

            "Dear Mr. Arif Shaikh , We want to inform you that John Adams has decided to leave the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.  This includes any effort to try and build a settlement with the sticking point 1.44.  This is a huge disappointment to our discussions earlier this year, when it seemed like there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.  We knew that negotiations were in very poor shape, and it appeared as if there might even be a lack of agreement.   I wanted to be sure you were aware of this and took the unusual step of writing to you on Friday, to gauge your reaction.  I knew you would be upset about Adams leaving, but I wanted to be sure this wasn't misinterpreted as a parting gift.   Thanks so much.  It's good to hear from you.  How's work? Where are you? Do you live in a house with other engineers?  We need to bring him home ASAP so he can get some distance from home.   I'll write again on Monday to bring you up to date.    P.S. If there's anything I can do to help you cope with this loss, just ask.  It's been quite a journey.  I'm sure your son will be just as upset about this as I was.  It's been quite a journey because of course he will be.  We will be reunited as Christians, but I'm not sure he will be ready for it.  I need to start this week on top, so that's the plan.  You have my prayers for a speedy recovery.   Love, Dad \n",

I inherited a total of $28,500,000.00 US (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars) from my late father which I honourably intend to use for investment purposes in your country. In view of this, I want you to assist me to transfer the money to your account for investment purpose. The source of the fund is as follows: During my father's active years in the government, he had deposited the sum of $20, 000,000.00 (Twenty Million United States Dollars) with a Reliance Bank here in Johannesburg, South Africa. The fund was a byproduct of the sales of Diamond from Zimbabwe and South Africa which the government declared war on to the farmers in Zimbabwe during the war. The government of President Robert Mugabe has been extorting money from Zimbabwe in order to purchase Arms and Ammunition for his military and political parties. In view of this, Zimbabwe's Farmers are being exploited by the government and some Major companies that control major sectors of the economy have frozen their accounts in Zimbabwe to avoid capture by Zimbabwean Mission. I cannot release the fund from their custody unless a foreigner applies for claim as next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. If you are interested, please get back to me as soon as possible to enable us start the processing of the transfer of the fund to your account in your country without further delay and please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Kindly call me on my private telephone number including the land line for easier communication and also for legal maintenance of the funds in your account. Thank you and God bless you and family.

I am married to the Abacha of which I am now making application to establish and to obtain for my self a.k.a my two children (a boy and girl) from my late husband who are now in the care of the (UNHCR). This is so that my children will have a better life and future. Before the death of my late husband, he had taken me to United Nation of Children (UNICEF) saveorate- General (G.N.S.) in Ghana where I am presently staying and to the United Nation (W.N.O) where I presently work as a representative for the United Nation Children's Fund (UNAFILM). After my husband was killed by a group known as the \"New Patriotic Congress(N.P.C.) at the hands of the war criminal (Rashid Kaduna) for the control of the former President of Nigeria (U.M.G) General Sani Abacha,I used my power as a business partner to secure in my country the sum of Fifty- eight million, United State Dollars ($48, 8 Million) which my late husband took from the treasury before his death. The money was realised from over invoiced contract invoiced from various foreign contracting army and government bodies. The sum of US$48, 8 Million was organised into fourm dollars (Usd) for the supply and installation of new machines and office equipments in my country which are being developed under the assistance of the United Nation (UN). The machine and office equipments supply is being supplied by your country's machine shop.Please note that developing and operational tests for new machines and office equipments is being carried out in your country under my supervision.

            "Dear MR, JAMES NUTTE I'm sorry I was absent. I was in Denver working with Nike on a shoe project. I was going down to LA on June 10 and 11, and then on Friday June 13 I'm going to take the boys to school in SoDo, and then back on Sunday June 15. Landon is having lunch with his coach and I was going to take the girls to the locker room for lunch. But I didn't  choose to do either because it would have violated the rest of our  schedule. Also, I just found out today that my wife is expecting our first child  and we're planning on having another one shortly. So I can't get any time off the calendar.  I guess we'll just have to put the plan in motion  now that we have a few new additions to the family. I'll still be in  LA on Monday, though. I just wanted to be sure we were both on the same  calendar.  Please advise ASAP on what you and the boys want to do about soccer practice.  The girls just got  permission to play on the first team.  I plan on attending with my son.  Does that mean I can't take the boys to school?  I thought they were supposed to begin practicing on Monday  A.M.?\n",

            "I received a call today from Kent Schoenauer at Product Assurance concerning an international product we have been handling for  several months.  Mr. Schoenauer told me  that he had talked to its lead attorney and the  lead lawyer recused himself. So Mr. Schoenauer had to act  independently.  He advised me today that my options are limited and  only partially protective.  I could  sue the company,  but that would only involve naming the company  and seeking damages for the lead attorney.  The company would not be protected  by the covenant in the investment agreement.  Nor could the lead attorney receive any type of benefit  from this transaction.  The company would almost certainly suffer irreparable harm if this  were a part of a larger agreement.  Lastly, Mr. Schoenauer advised me that due diligence was required on  the part of the company and that there may be a better  way to protect investors than relying on  simple litigation.    I chose to take  this course of action because I knew it would be a part of my job  to do.   Investor relations calls like this are quite common,  and I feel that due diligence was not immediately forthcoming  from the company.    I received an unsolicited proposal from the  company on Monday.    I looked at the contract and found a number of  problems.   I informed the company that I was  going to review it on Tuesday.    On Wednesday morning, I  delivered my findings to the company's lawyer  (who is  not related to me) and on Thursday I  delivered my findings to the CEO and President (who are related to each other).    My call  with the company was  interesting.   The CEO seemed to be pretty cooperative and the  President seemed very reluctant to do  anything about it.   My conclusion  is that they need to do something about it  ASAP because it is affecting their stock price.   Their stock price has been consistently bad for several months;   it seems that they did  not want to do anything about it before the deadline.   I called several times and one of  them hung up on me.   I then tried again and again until I finally  got through to the CEO.   As a matter of fact, he still does not  seem to be very interested in doing anything about it;  he is out of the office\n",

            " Business proposal Dear Sir, I am Mr. Abdul-Jabbar a merchant of International repute and Banker with a reputable Banks here in Nigeria.I have urgent &amp; Confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an American Mining Consultant and immigrant to Nigeria with a  Capital of One Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars deposited in my Bank here under my  auspices as a tourist. Upon maturity, he sent a routine notification to my forwarded address but got no reply. After a month, he sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr. Mmedeza Osondu had died from an automobile crash. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mmedeza Osondu did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. The total amount in the bank is $7,000,000.00. In other words,the management of my bank has allowed this money to sit there unclaimed for a very long time. I wish to transfer this fund out of the bank and I alone know of the existence of this fund in the bank files. I will give you 20% of this fund for your assistance and 2% for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the course of this transaction.All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please reach me immediately through my confidential direct fax number +23416605019 or you can send the money to me through my secured email address. I will then provide you with more details. God be with you. Yours faithfully, Mr.M.Abdul Jagoh .\n",

As I wrote earlier, after this experience I have more or less forgiven  you.  We will get to see each other again on June 2nd and I want to be there for June 2nd.  If June 2nd means anything to you, then you will feel better about the \"final decision\".  If not, then you need to tell me.  This \"settlement\" has not been made and we need to get together again so that I can apologize to you for the \"pain\" that this \"settlement\" has caused.  For June 1st I will be in the Atlanta office, in case you are wondering where I am.  June 2nd will be another exciting month for me because I will be moving from the LA office to the Atlanta office so that I can be with my family on June 15th.  Honestly I am not sure why we have not been able to \"see eye to eye\" on this \"issue\" in LA.  I felt that you were the one that \"outed\" me as gay to my co-workers and I.  You said that you knew I was gay, yet you did not \"confirm\" my \"gayness\" with your friends or my superior.  Your denial is not only foolish, but it is also a disservice to the cause.
